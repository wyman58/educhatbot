"Position","Question","Answer"
1,"Does the Smart Choices Strategy apply just to food and drinks sold in tuckshops?","No, the Smart Choices Strategy applies to all situations where food and drink is supplied in the school environment. This includes vending machines, school excursions, school camps, fundraising, classroom rewards, school events such as celebrations and sports days, and food used in curriculum activities."
2,"Can children still bring birthday cakes to school to share with their classmates?","Yes, birthday cakes can still be brought to school on a child's birthday. This is because these foods are brought from home. The Smart Choices Strategy only applies to foods and drinks supplied by the school."
3,"Does the Smart Choices Strategy apply to food and drinks brought from home e.g. in student lunch boxes?","No, it does not apply to foods and drinks brought from home. While schools may wish to encourage healthy eating practices, the decision about the types of foods and drinks contained in a child's lunchbox is entirely a matter for individual parents."
4,"Are state schools required to implement the strategy?","Yes. The implementation of Smart Choices is mandatory in Queensland state schools and strongly encouraged for non-state schools."
5,"Does the strategy apply to both primary and secondary state schools?","Yes, the Smart Choices Strategy is mandatory for all state schools in Queensland - primary, secondary and special schools."
6,"Does the food provided by boarding schools need to be consistent with the Smart Choices strategy?","Students living as residents at boarding school receive the majority of their daily food and drink intake from these facilities, so it is important they have access to healthy food required for growth, to maintain a healthy weight and to prevent the development of chronic diseases."
7,"What does two occasions per term mean?","An occasion is any instance where food or drink is supplied to students by the school. Supply includes the offering for sale of food or drink to students."
8,"Why is the availability of RED food and drinks being limited to no more than twice per term?","It is very important that children and young people eat a wide variety of foods from the five basic food groups to ensure that their bodies get all the nutrients they need for growth and development."
9,"Why are RED food and drinks restricted for teenagers? Don't they need RED foods to meet extra energy requirements?","Compared to children, young people have higher needs for energy and nutrients during rapid growth and development."
10,"Does Smart Choices apply to the school's swimming club?","Smart Choices should be applied to all school swimming clubs, regardless of whether the school is using their own school pool or an outside pool to conduct these regular events. All foods and drinks supplied at these events should be from the GREEN or AMBER categories. If RED foods or drinks are supplied to students (e.g. through sale at the canteen), then the event would need to be counted as one of the two occasions per term when RED foods and drinks may be supplied."
11,"Does Smart Choices apply to the school's swimming carnival?","Smart Choices should be applied to all individual school swimming carnivals, regardless of whether the school is using their own school pool or an outside pool. All foods and drinks supplied at these events should be from the GREEN or AMBER categories. If RED foods or drinks are supplied to students (e.g. through sale at the canteen), then the event would need to be counted as one of the two occasions per term when RED foods and drinks may be supplied."
12,"Does Smart Choices apply to my school's Out of School Hours Care and Vacation Care programs?","As part of their accreditation process all Out of School Hours Care services must provide a written nutrition policy that was developed/revised in consultation with families and is consistent with advice from recognised nutrition authorities. This nutrition policy would reflect the intent of Smart Choices which is to supply healthy food and drink options to students. Services may wish to use the Smart Choices strategy to inform the development of their nutrition policy. When developing fundraising activities, OSHC run by P&C associations should consider activities that support the healthy eating messages being given across the school environment."
13,"What support is available to help tuckshops implement Smart Choices?","The Queensland Association of School Tuckshops and NAQ Nutrition have a range of resources and services available to help tuckshops such as fact sheets, newsletters, buyers guides, advisory service, and trade expos."
14,"How often can we serve foods and drinks in the AMBER category?","Foods and drinks in the AMBER category are not restricted in how often they can be supplied. However, as these foods and drinks are mainly processed, with some sugar, salt or fat added to them, they shouldn't dominate the menu at the expense of healthier choices. It is recommended that you limit the serving size of AMBER foods and drinks and choose products that contain reduced levels of saturated fat, salt or sugar when compared to regular products. Schools may choose to limit the supply of some AMBER foods to only certain days of the week."
15,"Does food cooked at home and sold in the tuckshop need to be consistent with Smart Choices?","Food cooked at home and offered for sale through the tuckshop needs to be consistent with the Green and Amber categories of Smart Choices."
16,"Are there any food safety regulations I need to be aware of when cooking food at home for sale in the school tuckshop?","Yes, schools and parents/caregivers should be aware of food safety in relation to selling food cooked from home. All food must be handled to ensure it is safe for sale; this includes preparation, cooking, storage and transportation. Hot savoury dishes are high risk foods compared to baked products such as cakes and biscuits and need to be handled carefully."
17,"How does the Smart Choices Strategy affect classroom rewards?","Food rewards provided to students must comply with the Smart Choices Strategy, including food vouchers. Activities and rewards consistent with the strategy will also support the school curriculum."
18,"Do fundraising activities such as chocolate and pie drives have to comply with the Smart Choices Strategy?","Yes, food and drinks used for fundraising events must comply with the 'Occasional' RED food and drink criteria outlined in the strategy."
19,"Will tuckshop profits decrease as a result of implementing the Smart Choices Strategy?","It is often assumed that students will not buy healthier food and drinks from the tuckshop, and as a result it will lose business. However, students will buy healthy food and drinks when available, when they are promoted well, and when they have been involved in the decisions about what is sold. Students will keep coming back to the tuckshop if the food looks and tastes great."
20,"How does GST classification impact on food and drink classification under Smart Choices?","The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) classifies food and drinks based on tax law to determine if the food is eligible to include the Good and Services Tax (GST). This classification system used by the ATO does not include specific nutrient criteria."
21,"Can we have more than one Red occasion on the same day? For example, can we have a disco, class party and cake stall on the same day that all involve Red food and drinks.","You cannot have three Red occasions (eg. disco, class party and cake stall) either on a specific day, or across the term. You can have no more than two RED occasions per term. These occasions can be on the same day or spread across the term. There are many ways to make special occasions compliant with Smart Choices by offering Green and Amber foods and drinks. If you offer only Green or Amber foods and drinks on your special occasions, you can have as many of these occasions as you like."
22,"What is confectionery?","Confectionery includes chocolates, carob and yoghurt based confectionery, and all types of lollies such as boiled lollies, cough lollies, liquorice, lollies made from fruit juice, and jelly lollies. All confectionery falls into the RED category of the Smart Choices Food and Drink Spectrum."
23,"Why are lollies containing yoghurt and fruit juice in the RED category?","These lollies contain minimal nutritional value. Smart Choices includes examples of good sources of milk, yoghurt, cheese and alternatives, and fruit; e.g. one 200g tub of reduced fat yoghurt, one piece of fruit or cup of fruit juice."
24,"What types of drinks are the healthiest options for children and young people?","Water and plain milk are the healthiest drinks for children and young people and should be readily available and promoted in schools."
25,"Can we supply full-fat milk products to students?","Yes, under the Smart Choices strategy full-fat milk products are classified as Amber products and are therefore not limited in their supply in schools, but should be selected carefully. Reduced-fat plain milk is classified as Green under Smart Choices and is a healthier choice for children. The Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend that the consumption of reduced fat milk products is encouraged in children over two years of age to reduce saturated fat intake."
26,"Why are plain water, milk and at least 99% non-carbonated fruit or vegetable juice the only drinks that can be supplied in the school setting?","The 
                  Australian Dietary Guidelines External link and the 
                  National Healthy School Canteens Guidelines (NHSC) External link recommend that sugar-sweetened and intensely sweetened drinks such as soft drinks, flavoured waters, vitamin/nutrient waters, sports drinks, fruit drinks with less that 99% juice and iced tea, are limited to occasional consumption. These drinks are low in nutritional value and may provide excess energy (kilojoules). These drinks fit into the Red category of the Smart Choices food and drink spectrum and their supply is limited to no more than two occasions per term."
27,"What is the maximum serving size for fruit or vegetable juice?","Only fruit or vegetable juice which is at least 99% juice and is not carbonated is permitted to be supplied in schools. These juices fit into the Amber category of the Smart Choices food and drink spectrum. The maximum serving size is 250mL. Fuit drinks 
                  DO need to be assessed against the Occasional (Red) food and drink criteria table. 
                  One serving needs to contain 
                  less than 300 kilojoules and 100mg of sodium to fit in the Amber category. It is recommended that the serving size of fruit drinks is limited to 250mls or less, however, depending on the ingredients used, some large serving sizes may still fit into the Amber category - check the label against the Occasional (Red) food and drink criteria table. Drinks containing artificial sweeteners fit into the Red category regardless of their energy (kilojoule) content or serving size."
28,"How is jelly classified under Smart Choices?","All jelly, jelly sticks, jelly lollies and puddings including frozen products fit into the Red category of the Smart Choices food and drink spectrum. Jelly should not be included on tuckshop menus."
29,"What is a 'serving' in the 'Occasional' food and drink criteria table?","A serving is the size of the food or drink as sold or provided. It refers specifically to the pack size as sold or provided. This may be different to the serving size listed on the nutrition information panel."
30,"Why isn't there a sugar level in the nutrient criteria?","The 'Occasional' (Red) food and drink criteria table does not include a total sugar criteria. To keep the criteria as simple as possible and to ensure that foods containing naturally occurring sugars such as dairy products and fruit were not disadvantaged, no specific sugar criteria have been included. However, by setting a limit on the total kilojoule content of the product, the amount of sugar that can be added is limited. All types of confectionery, and many snacks and sugar sweetened drinks will fall into the Red category."
